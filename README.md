## Introduction  
This is a simulator for online car-hailing and realistic route calculation. This simulator was implemented with A star algorithm.

## Desciption
Due to limited space, I only describe one important part of the code sample in this project. The scripts in the **AStar** folder implement the logic of pathfinding. AStarMgr.cs is the program of the A-Star algorithm, and AStarMgr_Optimal.cs is an optimized version of the AStarMgr.cs, which improved the performance of the algorithm with the Red-Black tree. Those txt files record the performance data and map configuration. To know more details, please read the documentation of this project.
